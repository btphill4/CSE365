Description: My secure_house program was made in c++. The way I solved this program was by using vectors for everything. I included two header files, houseKey.h and people.h. In each of these headerfiles, it creates a string vector where I can add keys or the names of people to the vector. In my houseKeys.h file, it adds the key to the vector, it can print the keys(more for bug testing), it can delete the key(while readding firefigher key after), and I used a boolean method to search for the key. It compares the vector with a key to look for and returns true whether it is found or not. The people.h file is similiar and can search for people as well as it prints the WHO'S INSIDE? command. My actual file contains four methods. CommandToVector which finds the first two elements entered, which are the actions, and use them to run if statements on. I also use parseInput to push the string command to the vector. I also have findKey and findName which returns the name or the key we are looking for to assign to local string variables. Once the program is run, it returns an error if the command input is less than 2 (no key or no owner name). It then sets the owner to the 2nd element in the argv array. I add the firefighter key before I enter the while loop. The finalCommand variable is how I check the if statements for the action in the user input. After it enters the while loop, it runs through the various if statements looking for the actions as 'ENTERHOUSE' because the commandToVector method combines them into one string. Each if statement runs the actions and commmands that are neccessary for each portion.
