Bandit6: I used ls -al initially to look through the directories but found nothing that was useful. I used the find command and looked for files created by bandit7 and bandit6 by using find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c. It searched and returned Permission denied to several places and only had one place that showed me where the file was located at and I used cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password and it returned the password.

Bandit7: I tried the ls command and found the data.txt file. I used cat data.txt and it loaded the list of entries, so I tried sort data.txt, but the terminal didn't reach the line I was searching for. I then used cat data.txt | grep "millionth" to search data.txt for the word "millionth." It returned the line with the password. cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV

Bandit8: To pass this level I tried the ls command and found data.txt. It had hundreds of lines of text so I used the uniq -u command doing cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u which searched the txt file for a unique line. UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR

Bandit 9: I initiually used ls to find data.txt. Using cat data.txt returned me a on of unreadable letters so I searched through lines using "=". I used strings data.txt | grep '='. It searched all the strings for "=" and it displayed a few different lines of results. truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk

Bandit 10: Using ls I found data.txt again. The problem mentioned it was base64 for I used base64 -d data.txt to read the data file which returned me the password. IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR
