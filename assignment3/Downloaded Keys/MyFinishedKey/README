I thought this project was really cool and different. I was able 
to explain to my friends about how these gpg keys work 
and how windows uses them vs how linux OS uses them. This project made 
me interact with other students more than I have every before in any class.
The assignment overall wasn't difficult once I got the hang of it but this
is a great way to teach gpg key concepts. I didn't trick anyone personally
but I saw several great tactics and ideas, like someone using a website domain
they own to first get his keys signed then a few days later trick students 
a fake key and fake name but the same website.
